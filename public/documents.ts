CASE #: 23-1214
REPORTING DEPUTY: Lindsey W4917
CONFIDENTIAL: NO
PCN #: WASO 0102938 C
Narrative:
***Body worn camera footage available on evidence.com***
On March 10, 2023, I, Deputy Lindsey was assigned to work patrol for the Washoe County Sheriff's Office.
At approximately 2219 hours I responded to 120 Heindel Road in Reno Nevada on the report of a stolen motorcycle. The reporting party and registered owner of the motorcycle is Brandon Pearson.
Upon arrival, I met with Brandon Pearson out front of the residence. Brandon provided me with a verbal and written statement. Below is a synopsis of his statements:
Brandon received a phone call from Marie, who stays in a trailer in front of the house, stating his motorcycle had been stolen by Cameron on Thursday March 9th. Brandon had been busy working and did not stay at the 120 Heindel address the night prior. Brandon returned to the Heindel address and noticed his motorcycle was no longer in front of the house. Brandon stated Cameron does not have access to the motorcycle and has never been given consent to take the motorcycle. Brandon stated he watched video footage from Marie's trailer, and he can clearly see Cameron taking the motorcycle. Brandon called the police when he realized the motorcycle was stolen.
While speaking with Brandon, Cameron stepped out on the front porch of the residence. I approached Cameron to get his side of the events that occurred. Cameron provided me with a verbal statement. Below is a synopsis of his statement.
Cameron has been having issues with his roommate Brandon for the past few weeks. Cameron stated he had a previous roommate move out and now Brandon is refusing to pay him rent. I asked Cameron what was going on with the motorcycle. Cameron stated he did not know anything about a motorcycle.
Next, I met with Marie Engelhorn. Marie lives in a trailer in front of the 120 Heindel address. Marie provided me with a verbal and written statement. Below is a synopsis of her statements:
On March 9th Marie heard a motorcycle engine revving outside of her trailer. Marie has a security camera on the exterior of her trailer and when she heard the revving she turned the camera towards where she thought she heard the revving coming from. Marie observed who she knows to be Cameron clearing snow from around the motorcycle and clearing a path down the driveway of the home. Marie then observed Cameron move the vehicle which was parked in the driveway forward and out of the way. Marie watched Cameron get on the motorcycle and drive away down Heindel Road and toward North Virginia Street. Approximately 20-30 minutes later Cameron returned home in a car with his mother. Marie stated she believes Cameron took the motorcycle to his mother's house due to his mother returning him home without the motorcycle. Marie did not know where his mother's house is. Marie stated Cameron had asked her if she knew where Brandon kept the title to the motorcycle.
Marie showed me the videos she had of Cameron shoveling the driveway, clearing a path for the motorcycle, and ultimately driving away on the motorcycle.
In the video you can clearly identify Cameron clearing the drive way and driving away on the motorcycle. Cameron was wearing the same jacket, pants, and shoes on this night as he was the day prior in the video. The physical description of Cameron also matches the person in the video.
All videos of Cameron stealing the motorcycle were uploaded to evidence.com under case #WC230001214. Photographs of Cameron were also taken to show he was wearing the same clothes he was when he stole the motorcycle.
I spoke with Cameron again and Cameron again stated he did not know anything about a motorcycle. Cameron finally did admit to driving the motorcycle off the property and down the street but did not know where it was anymore.
A routine records check revealed Cameron is an ex-felon and is required to register as an ex-felon in the state of Nevada. Cameron's last registered address was at 1605 McKinley Dr. Cameron is now currently living at 120 Heindel Rd. This is a violation of NRS 179C.100.
Cameron was arrested and transported to the Washoe County Detention Facility.
While driving to the Washoe County Detention Facility, Cameron stated Brandon gave him the motorcycle as collateral for not paying rent. However, when I initially spoke with Cameron, he claimed he did not know anything about a motorcycle.
Cameron was booked in on the following charges:
NRS 205.228- Grand Larceny of a Motor Vehicle- Cameron intentionally drove away Brandon's motorcycle with no intention of returning the motorcycle. Cameron is seen on camera shoveling snow, clearing a path, and driving away.
NRS 179C.100- Convicted person Failure to Register- Cameron is a convicted Felon and is required to register. Cameron stated he is currently living at 120 Heindel Rd. Cameron's last registered address is 1605 McKinley Dr.
Prior to completing this report Deputies Kee, Heinrich, and Jaquez went to 1605 McKinley Drive. This is where Cameron's mother lives. The motorcycle was in the backyard of the residence and Brandon requested the vehicle be towed. This address is where Brandon stated the motorcycle was taken to.
Nothing further.

Tenant, appearing in proper person, requests this Court to stay (delay) and/or set aside the summary eviction order in this case.

Following reasons: Cameron Church is not the landlord or any agent thereof. He is a renter that has been harassing (SEE BACK)
...
[Handwritten addition]
...us since March 19 2023 when he was arrested for a felony in which I am the sole material witness. Sherriff's deputies have had to be called to our residence in excess of 13-17 times since then because of this harassment. They have told Cameron 5 or 6 times that he can't evict us and needs the homeowner to do that. They have informed me numerous times that he can't evict us for the same reason. In the last 6 weeks I have filed for a TPO, and multiple police reports for vandalism, theft and destruction of property. He continually threatens us w/ bodily harm or to tow our RV when we aren't there. This effort to impersonate the property owner and evict us is just another step in his campaign of terror and harm against me. The actual landlord's name is Wises Garcia, but I don't have his number. Second, Cameron destroyed the power cables to my RV & vandalized the outlet denying us electricity since March 10. He also broke our agreement upon move-in that we would have full access to the house, further denying us running water and bathroom facilities. I would ask to please STAY THE EVICTION request and.
